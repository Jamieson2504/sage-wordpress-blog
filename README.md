# Sage Wordpress Blog

Author: Mike Jamieson\
Version: 1.0\
PHP Requirement: 8.2

This is a custom Wordpress theme built using the Sage boilerplate by Roots (<https://github.com/roots/sage>).

Please make sure you have the GSAP (and member plugins) files downloaded from the GSAP website in a folder named 'gsap-bonus' in the root of your theme. If you don't have access to these plugins, I would advise installing the trial version via a package manager and amending the references in the main `app.js` file.

To get up and running using NVM and Yarn:

1. Run `nvm use` to switch to the correct version of node.
2. Run `yarn` to install dependencies
3. Run `yarn` dev to spinup server for hmr
